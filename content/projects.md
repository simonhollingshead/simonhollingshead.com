I come up with a lot of ideas for things to work on, but I really struggle to get started with them.  Sometimes it's the fact that after working on tech stuff for 40 hours a week at work, I don't have the energy to do it all again at home.  Sometimes it's the fact I don't have the equipment to do the project.  Sometimes it's something else getting in the way or lack of motivation rearing its ugly head.

Sometimes I do projects that only matter to me (scripts that make my life easier) and don't feel the need to make them available more broadly.

However, below is a list of projects I've either done or have plans for which are worth publicising.

# GPM (The Generic Package Manager)

My third-year University project to create a secure generic package manager framework that could be used by any project.

I did a [presentation]({{% link gpm_preview_presentation.pdf %}}) before completing it (though if you weren't in the room it's probably lacking in detail to be useful), and produced a 12,000 word [dissertation]({{% link gpm_dissertation.pdf %}}) as a quarter of my third-year exam marks.

# BOSSIT (Convert my website to use Hugo)

Having a heavyweight software package just to show a few links and a few writeups felt excessive.  Ever since finding out about static site generators (especially after GitHub pages became a thing) I had wanted to replace it all.

No need for any links to explain this one - *you're looking at it right now*.

# Secret Project 1

A relatively large project to create a new tool online which I'm relatively sure multiple companies in multiple different industries have already built internally but won't release due to the percieved advantage it gives them.

* Backend (codename THEYARE)
* Enrichment Sources: (incl. codenames FREEDICT1, FREEDICT2, FALLINGPRO, MONKEYTAKEOVER)
* Frontend (codename CHEESEBOARD)

# Secret Project 2 (codename SOUTHIMP)

Just something which has annoyed me while shopping for years and I'd like to solve more publicly at the same time as fixing it for myself (and my parents).

# Secret Project 3 (codename LIFEZERO)

A project designed to track if I'm getting more organised over time.
