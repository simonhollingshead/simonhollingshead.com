If you've reached this explanation page, it'll likely either be because:

* You searched something weird on Google and it returned my 'minis' subdomain (or this explanation page) as a search result, or
* You tried to go directly to https://minis.simonhollingshead.com/ and were redirected here.

**The 'minis' subdomain is not designed to be explored.  It is, by definition, a place for pre-release projects.  If you do not know the directory name for a given project, then it is not ready for you to look at it yet (and no, I don't name directories by their [project names](/projects/)).**

I do this for convenience - separating terrible pre-release code from my actual website - but also so I can do hacky things like changing PHP .ini files or .htaccess files without risk of collateral damage.  At worst, it breaks more than one not-yet-ready project!
