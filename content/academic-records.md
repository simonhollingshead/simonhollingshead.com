# Why?

As I continue through my career, my academic history becomes less and less relevant, but I see no reason in hiding my previous performance behind some form of 'available on request' message.

In the interest of openness, here are the exact results I got through the entirety of my academic career.

# University of Cambridge - BA (Hons.), MA (Cantab.)

*Note: My Oxbridge MA was issued in 2018.  See [my explanation of Cambridge degrees](/cambridge-degrees/) for more information about the Oxbridge MA.*

[^1]: This paper was marked like an old-style A-level (pre-A*).  B is the second-highest available grade.  This paper was also worth up to 20 UCAS points, with a B being worth 17.
[^2]: Equivalent to four GCSEs, A\*, A\*, A, A.
[^3]: I always found these papers interesting.  M8, M9 and M10 separately could only assess extremely narrow bands of candidates.  M10 could only tell you if a candidate was A*, A, or neither.  M9 would then tell you if a candidate was 'A or better', B, or neither, and M8 'B or better', C, or neither.  To quote Ofqual/12/5154 (Review of Standards in GCSE Mathematics, April 2012): *"[T]he grade range for the module paper was much narrower than that in the terminal paper. [...]. The effect of these modules was to offer students more opportunities to show what they know understand and can do at each grade within the paper."*
[^4]: 'Short Course' GCSEs are only worth half a GCSE.
[^5]: Each worth equivalent to half a 'passing' GCSE (e.g. &half; of a C grade).
