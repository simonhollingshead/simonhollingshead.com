By this point in my career, I've had my share of experiences with recruiters from many companies.  My academic background and my career so far makes my profile show up quite often on recruiters' searches via LinkedIn, it seems.

Sadly, LinkedIn doesn't have a way to say "Not open to finding a new job" and, understandably, the assumption seems to be that people who have left it in their default (unset) state are probably still interested in being contacted.

As such, I generally ignore most approaches to avoid wasting both our time.  I also report all unwanted LinkedIn connection requests as "I don't know *$name*" because I'm not adding LinkedIn connections that I can't personally vouch for.

If I'm looking, I'll indicate that, but I still have one key expectation: provide a **detailed** job specification by email.  I don't want to take a call to have the spec described to me to find it's something I have no interest in; just send me it.

In addition, the following companies are **banned from contacting me** and will have their emails automatically deleted as a result of *extremely* negative experiences for which subsequent complaints were improperly handled:
