Unfortunately, during the times I have looked for jobs, I have had some poor experiences with some specific recruiters (both in-house and external).

This list contains the domains of each company who have their emails *automatically deleted from my inbox*.

This is not just a list of companies that made mistakes, this is a list of companies who made an unforgivable error, but then **also subsequently mishandled a complaint about those mistakes**.  I have no faith in them as a result, and would not trust them enough to do business with them in future.
