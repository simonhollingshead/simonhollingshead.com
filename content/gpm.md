My third-year University project was to create a secure generic package manager framework that could be used as a replacement for the backend of existing package managers.

The main focus was on protecting against classes of attack which existing package managers at the time were known to be vulnerable to.

I did a [presentation](/gpm_preview_presentation.pdf) before completing it (though if you weren't in the room it's probably lacking in detail to be useful), and produced a 12,000 word [dissertation](/gpm_dissertation.pdf) as a quarter of my third-year exam marks.
